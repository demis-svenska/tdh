# 40. Install new `apt` requirements on machines running commcarehq code

**Date:** 2021-01-08

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
We will be adding SAML 2.0 Single Sign On (SSO) support over the next few months which
requires installing new `apt` packages as dependencies of python requirements.

## Details
In order to install python dependencies necessary for handling SAML 2.0 authentication
on CommCare HQ, we must install several `apt` packages that are dependencies of these
new `pip` requirements. Any machine running `commcarehq` code must have these `apt` packages
installed in order for `pip` requirements installations to complete successfully.

## Steps to update
Run the following `deploy-stack` command:

```shell
commcare-cloud <env> deploy-stack --tags=hq-apt-requirements
```
