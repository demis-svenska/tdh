# 42. Update Formplayer request mapping

**Date:** 2021-03-16

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
A small change to the nginx request matching for Formplayer requests that will prevent
an additional `/` from being prepended to the Formplayer requests.

## Details
With the current configuration Formplayer requests are getting an additianal `/` prepended
to the request path resulting in requests like `//new-form`.

Updating the nginx configuration will remove the double slash from Formplayer requests.

Future versions of Formplayer will reject requests containing double slashes.

## Steps to update
```shell
commcare-cloud <env> ap deploy_proxy.yml --tags=nginx_sites
```
