## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
In preparation for the release of Formplayer Java 17 version, we have shipped a few infrastructure changes through Commcare Cloud. 
At this point, the ask to those maintaining CommCare instances is to follow the steps below to configure Java 17 for Formplayer.

    <pre style="background-color:#f8f8f8" class="code literal-block">
    formplayer_java_version: "&#123;&#123; java_17_bin_path }}/java"
    </pre>
    +++
3. Update Formplayer 
    ```
