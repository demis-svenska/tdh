# 38. Update PostgreSQL monit configurations to be version specific

**Date:** 2020-10-22

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
Update PostgreSQL monit configuration files to be version specific and use `systemctl`

## Details
When upgrading PostgreSQL you are likely to have both old and new versions installed on the same machine.
In order to provide full controll over the individual service processes with monit it is necessary to use
different configurations for each one.

This change includes the version number in the file name and also updates the config to allow
monit to control only the process with that version (instead of all PostgreSQL processes on the host).

## Steps to update
```bash
commcare-cloud <env> ansible-playbook deploy_postgres.yml --tags monit
```
