**Date:** 2022-05-25

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
Run command to update shell runner scripts for django and celery.

## Details
The runner scripts used by `supervisord` to run celery and django have been
updated so that they reflect the "wrapped exit code" when they exit. This
provides visibility of the django/celery exit status by viewing the
`supervisord` logs.

## Steps to update
Run the following command to update supervisor configs:

```bash
cchq <env> update-supervisor-confs
```
