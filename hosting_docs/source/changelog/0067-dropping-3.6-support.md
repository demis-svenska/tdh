# 67. Dropping support for 3.6

**Date:** 2022-12-20

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
Commcare-cloud will no longer attempt to support Python 3.6. We strongly
encourage you to follow the steps below to upgrade to Python 3.10 if you have
not done so already.

## Details
As part of our ongoing effort to keep CommCare HQ up to date with the latest
tools and libraries we are recommending that commcare-cloud run on Python
3.10. Python 3.6 has reached end of life and we will no longer make an effort
to support it on commcare-cloud.

## Steps to update
Follow the steps below to properly install Python 3.10 and its dependencies.
```
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get -y install python3.10 python3.10-dev python3.10-distutils python3.10-venv libffi-dev
```
Once Python 3.10 is installed on your control machine, run:
```
update-code
```
which will pull the latest version of commcare-cloud and trigger the creation and activation of a Python 3.10 virtual environment.

Confirm the active virtual environment is using Python 3.10
```
python --version
```
Finally, run:
```
manage-commcare-cloud configure
```
