# 49. Postgres upgrade from 9.6 to 10

**Date:** 2022-06-03

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
This change upgrade PostgreSQL from 9.6 to 10 version.
As part of our ongoing effort to keep CommCare HQ up to date with the latest tools and
libraries we have updated PostgreSQL from version 9.6 to version 10.

## Details
PostgreSQL is strongly backwards compatible, so no coordination with the CommCare HQ codebase is required before this upgrade.
However, after six weeks, from this announcement, new changes to CommCare HQ will no longer be guaranteed
to be compatible with PostgreSQL 9.6, so we strongly recommend applying this upgrade as soon as possible.

## Steps to update
Before you start, make sure that you have backed up the existing PostgreSQL database servers
to a remote location.
