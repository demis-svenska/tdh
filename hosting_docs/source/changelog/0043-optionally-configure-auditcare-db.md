# 43. Optionally configure auditcare db

**Date:** 2021-03-23

**Optional per env:** _only required on some environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
Some enterprise deployments of CommCare use a backend feature called
"auditcare" as part of their audit logging strategy. Auditcare is enabled by
default, so it is active unless you went out of your way to disable it when
you configured CommCare. Historically it has used CouchDB as its data
backend, but it is being switched to use PostgreSQL instead. If you care
about this feature then you may want to carefully consider this change log
before your next commcare deploy; otherwise you can ignore.

## Details
After the next deploy from the latest version of CommCare HQ, auditcare will
begin writing to PostgreSQL. By default, it will write to tables within your
default PostgreSQL db. If you want to have it write to a different database
instead, you can configure this using the `LOCAL_CUSTOM_DB_ROUTING` variable
and an entry in postgresql.yml.

## Steps to update
There are no special steps if you are fine with the default.

To configure auditcare to go to its own PostgreSQL database instead, use the
following:

```
# public.yml
localsettings:
  LOCAL_CUSTOM_DB_ROUTING:
    auditcare: auditcare
```

Update your postgresql.yml to point to the right machine.

```
# postgresql.yml
dbs:
  auditcare:
    host: <machine>
```

Finally, run the following to apply the config:
```
cchq <env> ap deploy_postgres.yml
cchq <env> update-config
```
