[5ed5c54a](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/commit/5ed5c54aa4880bf0010a4001aa8693b979802e13)


## Change Context
Run command to create bootstrap audit records for existing user role records.

## Details
CommCare HQ uses the `django-field-audit` library to track changes on user
roles and related models. This command ensures that the database records for
these models which were created prior to adding the auditing logic get a
required "bootstrap" record in the audit table.

## Steps to update
Run the following command to create the bootstrap audit records:

```bash
cchq <env> django-manage bootstrap_field_audit_events top-up Permission RoleAssignableBy UserRole RolePermission
```
