context: |
  Commcare-cloud will no longer attempt to support Python 3.6. We strongly
  encourage you to follow the steps below to upgrade to Python 3.10 if you have
  not done so already.

details: |
  As part of our ongoing effort to keep CommCare HQ up to date with the latest
  tools and libraries we are recommending that commcare-cloud run on Python
  3.10. Python 3.6 has reached end of life and we will no longer make an effort
  to support it on commcare-cloud.

update_steps: |
  Follow the steps below to properly install Python 3.10 and its dependencies.
  ```
  sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt-get -y install python3.10 python3.10-dev python3.10-distutils python3.10-venv libffi-dev
  ```
  Once Python 3.10 is installed on your control machine, run:
  ```
  update-code
  ```
  which will pull the latest version of commcare-cloud and trigger the creation and activation of a Python 3.10 virtual environment.

  Confirm the active virtual environment is using Python 3.10
  ```
  python --version
  ```
  Finally, run:
  ```
  manage-commcare-cloud configure
  ```
