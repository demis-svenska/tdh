  Run command to create bootstrap audit records for existing user role records.

details: |
  CommCare HQ uses the `django-field-audit` library to track changes on user
  roles and related models. This command ensures that the database records for
  these models which were created prior to adding the auditing logic get a
  required "bootstrap" record in the audit table.

update_steps: |
  Run the following command to create the bootstrap audit records:

  ```bash
  cchq <env> django-manage bootstrap_field_audit_events top-up Permission RoleAssignableBy UserRole RolePermission
  ```
