context: |
  Postgres upgrade is recommended to be upgraded in two steps,upgrade from v10 to v13 and then to v14. 
  This change upgrade PostgreSQL from 10 to 13 and then to 14 version.
  As part of our ongoing effort to keep CommCare HQ up to date with the latest tools and libraries we have updated PostgreSQL from version 10 to version 14. 

details: |
  PostgreSQL is strongly backwards compatible, so no coordination with the CommCare HQ codebase is required before this upgrade.
  However, after six weeks, from this announcement, new changes to CommCare HQ will no longer be guaranteed to be compatible with PostgreSQL 10, so we strongly recommend applying this upgrade as soon as possible. 

update_steps: |
  Before you start, make sure that you have backed up the existing PostgreSQL database servers
  to a remote location.
