context: |
  Backfill data in the `sms_smssubevent` table to improve the performance of the 'messaging-event' API.
  
  This operation is only required if your environment is using SMS or Email workflows. Furthermore,
  an automatic migration will be added to CommCare in the future which will apply these changes
  during a code deploy if they have not already been applied.

details: |
  To improve the performance of the 'messaging-event' API we have denormalized some of the fields.
  The fields are already being populated for new data but a command needs to be executed to populate
  the columns for existing data.

update_steps: |
  Execute the following command:
  
  ```shell
  $ commcare-cloud <env> django-manage --tmux backfill_sms_subevent_date 
  ```
  
  Precautions:
  * No downtime is needed for this operation however it is best to run the command during a period
    of low traffic.
