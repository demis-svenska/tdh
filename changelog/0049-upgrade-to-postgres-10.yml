key: upgrade-to-Postgres-10

context: |
  This change upgrade PostgreSQL from 9.6 to 10 version.
  As part of our ongoing effort to keep CommCare HQ up to date with the latest tools and
  libraries we have updated PostgreSQL from version 9.6 to version 10.

details: |
  PostgreSQL is strongly backwards compatible, so no coordination with the CommCare HQ codebase is required before this upgrade.
  However, after six weeks, from this announcement, new changes to CommCare HQ will no longer be guaranteed
  to be compatible with PostgreSQL 9.6, so we strongly recommend applying this upgrade as soon as possible.

update_steps: |
  Before you start, make sure that you have backed up the existing PostgreSQL database servers
  to a remote location.
