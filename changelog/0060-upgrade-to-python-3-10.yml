  Follow these steps to install and use Python 3.10 on your control machine(s) by December 19th, 2022.

details: |
  As part of our ongoing effort to keep CommCare HQ up to date with the latest tools and
  libraries we are requiring that commcare-cloud run on Python 3.10. Python 3.6 has reached end of life,
  and we are requiring that everyone move to Python 3.10 by December 19th, 2022.

update_steps: |
  Follow the steps below to properly install Python 3.10 and its dependencies.

  $ sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
  $ sudo apt update
  $ sudo apt-get -y install python3.10 python3.10-dev python3.10-distutils python3.10-venv libffi-dev

  Once Python 3.10 is installed on your control machine, run:
  
  $ update-code

  which will pull the latest version of commcare-cloud and trigger the creation and activation of a Python 3.10 virtual environment.

  Confirm the active virtual environment is using Python 3.10

  $ python --version

  Finally, run:
  
  $ manage-commcare-cloud configure
